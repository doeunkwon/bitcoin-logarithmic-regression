### Note #1

- The accumulation log curve increases by one curve every cycle
- It goes from purple to blue to green
- The pattern suggests that the next accumulation log curve is yellow (20k - 30k)
- The bubble curve is consistently orange, though every cycle we creep towards red
- If alts still track BTC, then the graph seems to suggest an upcoming bear market
